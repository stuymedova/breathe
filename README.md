# Inhale. Hold. Exhale.

A small tool for calm deep and measured breathing otherwise known as 4-7-8 breathing.  
Practiced as a meditation excercise.

## Setup

To run the project locally, you'll need a server able to serve static files. I use [budo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/budo), and launch it using the `npx budo --live` command.
